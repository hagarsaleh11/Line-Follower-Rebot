# Line Follower Car using 5-Channel IR Sensor Module
This project involves building an autonomous line follower car using an Arduino-based control system and a 5-channel IR sensor module. The vehicle detects and follows a predefined path by continuously adjusting motor directions based on sensor input.
# Hardware Components Used:
-Arduino UNO R3
-L289N H-Bridge Dual Motor Driver
-TCRT5000L 5-Channel Line Tracking IR Sensor Module
-x2 Geared DC Motors
-12V 1800mAh Battery

# Path for the Line Follower(3.5 cm width)
The car follows a specific track, which can include turns and intersections as shown in the image below:
